\section{Results}
For each observation, we generated a convex likelihood function over
the area of the environment. We then chose the maximum value over the
distribution to be our MLE for the coordinates of the chosen
observation. Iterating over the entire data set, we generated a rough
plot of the building's layout.
For a data set of 427 observations of 191 access points, our algorithm
had a run time of about 10 to 20 seconds. We suspect that the run time
could be reduced substantially performing operations on a sparsified
design matrix.
