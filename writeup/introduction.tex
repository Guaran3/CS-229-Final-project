\section{Introduction}

There has long been interest in the ability to determine the physical
location of a device given only WiFi signal strength. This problem,
called WiFi localization, has important applications in activity
recognition, robotics, and surveillance. This is an extremely
challenging task that hes been researched for over a decade now.
Recent advances in mobile computing technology and the increasing
availability of WiFi networks have enabled more accurate localization
in indoor environments where GPS is less precise. Our goal in particular
was to find a way to localize something ubiquitous in today's society: the 
cell phone.
