The widespread availability of wireless networks has created an
increased interest in harnessing them for other purposes, such as 
localizing mobile devices. Our particular goal was to be able to 
use these techniques as well as others in order to better predict
the location of a smart phone inside a building.
The current state of the art techniques use Gaussian Process Latent Variable
Models to solve this problem. However, existing implementations of
this technique require ground traces (wifi data collected sequentially)
and are limited to signal-rich
environments. Due to the constraints of using phones for this,
we were restricted to non sequential data. Since this eleminates the possbility
of using traditional GP-LVM techniques, we created a locally weighted regression based machine
learning algorithm for geographical localization of a mobile device in
an indoor environment based on WiFi signal strength data. Our
contribution is a novel approach to generating adequate likelihood
models based on locally weighted sums of Gaussian probability 
densities. The results show that our algorithm is effectively deduces
the original floor plan of the environment and presents a more accurate
estimate of the device's location.
