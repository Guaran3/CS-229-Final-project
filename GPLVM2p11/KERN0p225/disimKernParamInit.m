function kern = disimKernParamInit(kern)

% DISIMKERNPARAMINIT DISIM kernel parameter initialisation.
%
%	Description:
%	The driven input single input motif (DISIM) kernel is specifically designed for
%	working with gene networks where there is assumed to be a single
%	transcription factor controlling several genes. This transcription
%	factor, in turn, is driven by its own gene's RNA. The model takes the
%	following form: each gene is
%	related to the transcription factor through the following
%	differential equation,
%	
%	dx(t)/dt = B + C f(t-delta) - D x(t),
%	
%	where D is a decay term, C is a response term, delta is a time delay
%	and B is an initial level. Then if f(t) is assumed to be the result of
%	a further differential equation,
%	
%	df(t)/dt = Sx'(t) - D' x'(t)
%	
%	where x'(t) is assumed to come from a Gaussian process with an RBF
%	covariance function f(t) is a Gaussian process with a covariance function
%	provided by the single input motif kernel (SIM) and x(t) is a Gaussian
%	process with covariance function provided by this kernel, the DISIM kernel.
%	
%	The kernel is designed to interoperate with the multiple output
%	block kernel so that f(t) can be inferred given several different
%	instantiations of x(t) (associated with different genes).
%	
%	The parameters (B, C, delta, S, D and D') are constrained positive.
%	
%
%	KERN = DISIMKERNPARAMINIT(KERN) initialises the single input motif
%	kernel structure with some default parameters.
%	 Returns:
%	  KERN - the kernel structure with the default parameters placed in.
%	 Arguments:
%	  KERN - the kernel structure which requires initialisation.
