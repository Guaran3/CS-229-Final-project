function [k, sk, n2] = ratquadKernCompute(kern, x, x2)

% RATQUADKERNCOMPUTE Compute the RATQUAD kernel given the parameters and X.
%
%	Description:
%
%	K = RATQUADKERNCOMPUTE(KERN, X, X2) computes the kernel parameters
%	for the rational quadratic kernel given inputs associated with rows
%	and columns.
%	 Returns:
%	  K - the kernel matrix computed at the given points.
%	 Arguments:
%	  KERN - the kernel structure for which the matrix is computed.
%	  X - the input matrix associated with the rows of the kernel.
%	  X2 - the input matrix associated with the columns of the kernel.
%
%	K = RATQUADKERNCOMPUTE(KERN, X) computes the kernel matrix for the
%	rational quadratic kernel given a design matrix of inputs.
%	 Returns:
%	  K - the kernel matrix computed at the given points.
%	 Arguments:
%	  KERN - the kernel structure for which the matrix is computed.
%	  X - input data matrix in the form of a design matrix.
