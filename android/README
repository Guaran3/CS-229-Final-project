This is the primary file for getting the info we need from android phones.  this
should be sufficient for the project, though I'm not exactly sure how this fits 
in with the rest of the glassmap code since I have still not seen it. This will
probably not need to be modified again. After finishing this, I'm no longer sure
that the iOS version will actually be helpful since it's only capable of 
collecting information about one AP at a time.
