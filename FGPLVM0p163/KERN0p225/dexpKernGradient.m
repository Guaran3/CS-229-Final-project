function g = dexpKernGradient(kern, x1, varargin)

% DEXPKERNGRADIENT Gradient of the double exponential kernel's parameters.
%
%	Description:
%	
%
%	G = DEXPKERNGRADIENT(KERN, X1, PARTIAL) computes the gradient of
%	functions with respect to the double exponential kernel's
%	parameters. As well as the kernel structure and the input positions,
%	the user provides a matrix PARTIAL which gives the partial
%	derivatives of the function with respect to the relevant elements of
%	the kernel matrix.
%	 Returns:
%	  G - gradients of the function of interest with respect to the
%	   kernel parameters. The ordering of the vector should match that
%	   provided by the function kernExtractParam.
%	 Arguments:
%	  KERN - the kernel structure for which the gradients are being
%	   computed.
%	  X1 - the input locations for which the gradients are being
%	   computed in the form of a design matrix.
%	  PARTIAL - matrix of partial derivatives of the function of
%	   interest with respect to the kernel matrix. The argument takes the
%	   form of a square matrix of dimension  numData, where numData is
%	   the number of rows in x1.
%
%	G = DEXPKERNGRADIENT(KERN, X1, X2, PARTIAL) computes the derivatives
%	as above, but input locations are now provided in two matrices
%	associated with rows and columns of the kernel matrix.
%	 Returns:
%	  G - gradients of the function of interest with respect to the
%	   kernel parameters.
%	 Arguments:
%	  KERN - the kernel structure for which the gradients are being
%	   computed.
%	  X1 - the input locations associated with the rows of the kernel
%	   matrix in the form of a design matrix.
%	  X2 - the input locations associated with the columns of the kernel
%	   matrix in the form of a design matrix.
%	  PARTIAL - matrix of partial derivatives of the function of
%	   interest with respect to the kernel matrix. The matrix should have
%	   the same number of rows as x1 and the same number of columns as x2
%	   has rows.
